# Model

## Recurrent Neural Networks

![http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/](images/rnn.jpg)

* Great for sequential data

## Long Short-Term Memory

![https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21](images/lstm.png){width=50%, height=50%}

* Better at processing longer sequences

## Our Model

* RNN with LSTM
* Trained its own embeddings
* Ran for 4 hours
  * 100 steps per epoch for 68 epochs
  
# Results

## A Lot of Caramel

## Ingredients Discrepancies

## Extract Recipe

* These are mash instructions for brew in bag

## Varying Temperature

* Literal nonsense

# Improvements

## Training

* Only used 3,119 out of ~200,000 recipes
  * Took days to get this, with scalable computing and more time, could train more data
* Hyperparameter tuning
  * Did not have time to tune hyperparameters as model training took 4 hours

## Output Cleaning

* Remove duplicates in ingredients section.
* Repair disconnect between ingredients and intructions.
